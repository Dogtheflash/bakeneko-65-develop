## Special thanks to

- **Elaine** for [Unikorn](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=98587.50). Allowed me to publish the Unikorn-inspired case as open source and encouraged me
- Of course, I also show my respect and gratitude to **yuktsi**
- **coarse** for PCB review and kind support. His great work has refined the PCB well

## Also I should mention

- **OTD** for 356 Mini. Origin of O-ring gasket mount style
- **Evy** for [Plain60 series](https://github.com/evyd13/plain60-c). I used it as a reference for my PCB design. They also answered my miscellaneous questions
- **ai03** for [MX_Alps_Hybrid](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid). Also got a lot of help from his discord server
- **overset** for [JP01](https://github.com/overset/JP01). The idea of publishing the case design on Onshape. After seeing their great work I switched from fusion360 to Onshape
- **Rhuk** gave me a lot of advice on keyboard design and manufacturing
- **Maker Keyboards** suggested adding a plate cutout to remove the PCB using a keycap puller
- And many community members for giving me advice and feedback, thanks!
